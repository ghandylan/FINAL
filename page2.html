    <p style="padding-left: 20em; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
      From CESAR's booklet entitled "The Structure of the Sun", He explains comprehensively the overview of the layers of the Sun namely:<br>
      1. Core<br>
      2. Radiative<br>
      3. Convention Zone<br>
      4. Photosphere<br>
      5. Corona<br><br>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 18em; font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px; text-align: justify;">
      <b>i.</b> Core is the root of all energy. It is extremely high temperature, and the material is composed of very dense due to the extremely high pressure. <br>
        The combination of these two properties creates an environment where nuclear reactions occured. These nuclear reactions always generate heavier elements on the periodic table. <br><br>

      <b>ii.</b> Radiative zone: The transport of energy from the Sun’s core (where it is produced) to the area surrounding it can be transmitted to radiation.  <br>
          This is how it travels from the center of the Sun to the outer area, hence the name “radiative zone”. Through this area of the solar interior, <br>
          the energy which in the form of radiation is transmitted by its interaction with the particles in the surrounding. <br>
          Some atoms can remain intact in the radiation zone since the temperature is slightly cooler than in the core. <br>
          These particles can absorb energy, reserve it for a short time, and then later release that energy as new radiation. <br>
          In this way, the generated energy in the core is transmitted from one atom to another, wandering on an upwards path, through the radiation zone. <br><br>

      <b>iii.</b> Convection zone: The energy that is initially created in the core needs a new transport mechanism to carry on its passage <br>
          to the Sun’s surface once it is out of the radiation zone. This is necessary since the temperature is relatively cool outside of the radiation zone <br>
          (2 million degrees Kelvin compared to 5 million in the radiation zone). <br>
          Atoms will absorb energy much more easily at this temperature, but they do not release it so readily since their surrounding is cool and dense. <br>
          Therefore, the energy transfer by radiation slows down considerably. The atoms are heated up by absorbing the and rise through the convection zone<br>
          bringing this energy (heat) towards the surface.<br><br>

      <b>iv.</b> Photosphere is also named the apparent surface of the Sun. Since the Sun is wholly made of gas, there is no solid surface (like there is on Earth). <br>
      However, when we observe the Sun, there is a depth past which the density of the gas becomes so high that we cannot see through it. <br>
      This region is called the photosphere, or as mentioned the apparent surface. <br>
      This is the disk that one sees in the sky when one looks at the Sun through a telescope that has a filter, or as a projection on, for example, a sheet of paper. <br><br>

      <b>v.</b> Chromosphere is the layer above the photosphere and is thicker than it. With a very low density, <br>
      it´s impossible to observe it without narrowband filters or during a total solar eclipse due to the brightness of the photosphere behind it. <br>
      Furthermore it’s less dense than the photosphere.<br><br>

      <b>vi.</b> The corona: It is the biggest and least dense structure of the Sun and it surrounds it. Composed of plasma escaping from the Sun that reaches 1.000.000 kelvin, <br>
      but with a density even lower than the chromosphere<br><br>

      <center><h2>Facts about the Sun</h2></center>
    <div class="sunfacts">
      <div>
        <ul>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun is 92.96 million miles (149.6 kilometers) away from Earth.<p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun is made of a ball of burning gases. These gases are 92.1% hydrogen and 7.8% helium.</  p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The sunlight we see on Earth left the Sun 8 minutes ago. This is the length of time it takes for the light to travel the distance between the Sun and the Earth.</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">When the moon goes around the Earth, it sometimes finds itself between the Earth and the Sun. <br>
                This is called a solar eclipse and makes the Earth dark whilst the moon shuts out most of the Sun’s light. <br>
                This only lasts for a couple of hours while the moon continues its rotation and moves out of the way of the sun.</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">In ancient astronomy, it was thought that the Sun moved. People believed that the Earth stayed still and the Sun rotated around it.</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">About 2000 years ago some began to think it was the Sun that stays still whilst the planets make a path around it. <br>
                 This only became an accepted theory around the 1600s when Isaac Newton proposed the sun-centric solar system.</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun is almost a perfect sphere. It is the closest thing to a sphere found in nature with only a 6.2 mile (10 kilometres) difference between its vertical and horizontal measurements.</li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun’s core is extremely hot! An unthinkable 13,600,000 degrees Celcius!</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun has a very big magnetic field. It is the most powerful magnetic field in the whole solar system. <br>
                This field is regenerating itself, but scientists are unsure how.</p></li>
          <li><p style="font-size: 17px;">The Sun produces solar winds. These are a stream of particles from the Sun that stream out into space. <br>
                  This is why planets atmospheres are so important. They protect the planet from these solar winds.</p></li>

    <center><h1>Star</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">A star is any massive self-luminous celestial body of gas that shines by radiation derived from its internal energy sources.<br>
       Of the tens of billions of trillions of stars in the observable universe, only a very small percentage are visible to the naked eye.</p>

    <h1>What is Stellar Nucleosynthesis</h1>

    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Stellar nucleosynthesis is the process by which elements are created within stars by combining the protons and neutrons together from the nuclei of lighter elements.<br>
       All of the atoms in the universe began as hydrogen. Fusion inside stars transforms hydrogen into helium, heat, and radiation.<br>
       Heavier elements are created in different types of stars as they die or explode (Jones, 2019).</p>

           A Giant Gas Cloud
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           A star begins life as a large cloud of gas. The temperature inside the cloud is low enough for molecules to form.
           Some of the molecules, such as hydrogen, light up and allow astronomers to see them in space.
           The Orion Cloud Complex in the Orion system serves as a nearby example of a star in this stage of life.

           A Protostar is a Baby Star
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           As the gas particles in the molecular cloud run into each other, heat energy is created, which allows a warm clump of molecules to form in the gas cloud.
           This clump is referred to as a Protostar. Since Protostars are warmer than other material in the molecule cloud, these formations can be seen with infrared vision.
            Depending on the size of the molecule cloud, several Protostars can form into one cloud.

           The T-Tauri Phase
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           In the T-Tauri stage, a young star begins to produce strong winds, which push away the surrounding gas and molecules.
           This allows the forming star to become visible for the first time. Scientists can spot a star in the T-Tauri stage without the help infrared or radio waves.
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 25px;">
           Main Sequence Stars
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           Eventually, the young star reaches hydrostatic equilibrium, in which its gravity compression is balanced by its outward pressure, giving it a solid shape. The star then becomes a main sequence star. It will spend 90 percent of its life in this stage, fusing hydrogen molecules and forming helium in its core. The sun of our solar system is currently in its main sequence phase.
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 25px;">
           Expansion to Red Giant
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           Once all of the hydrogen in the star's core is converted to helium, the core collapses on itself, causing the star to expand. As it expands, it first becomes a sub-giant star, then a red giant. Red giants have cooler surfaces than main sequence stars; and because of this, they will appear red rather than yellow. If the star is massive enough, it can become large enough to be classified as a supergiant.
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 25px;">
           Fusion of Heavier Elements
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           As it expands, the star begins fusing helium molecules in its core, and the energy of this reaction prevents the core from collapsing. Once helium fusion ends, the core shrinks, and the star begins fusing carbon. This process repeats until iron begins appearing in the core. Iron fusion absorbs energy, so the presence of iron causes the core to collapse. If the star is massive enough, the implosion creates a supernova. Smaller stars like the sun contract peacefully into white dwarfs while their outer shells radiate away as planetary nebulae.

         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 25px;">
           Supernovae and Planetary Nebulae
         </div>
         <div style="font-family: Garamond; font-size: 20px;">
           A supernova explosion is one of the brightest events in the universe. Most of the star's material is blown into the space, but the core implodes rapidly into a neutron star or a singularity known a s a black hole. Less massive stars don't explode like this. Their cores contract into tiny, hot stars called white dwarfs while the outer material drifts away. Stars smaller than the sun don't have enough mass to burn with anything but a red glow during their main sequence. These red dwarves, which are difficult to spot but which may be the most common stars out there, can burn for trillions of years. Astronomers suspect that some red dwarves have been in their main sequence since shortly after the Big Bang.
