                    <p>
                        Mercury is the planet that is nearest to the sun. It rotates slowly, roughly twice for every three orbits completed. Because of its closeness to the sun, its cratered surface may reach temperatures of up to 800 degrees Fahrenheit (426.7 degrees Celsius). Temperatures on the side facing away from the sun, on the other hand, are chilly â€” around -279 F. (-173 C). It is the smallest planet in the solar system, little bigger than Earth's moon. It has no moons or rings, and its atmosphere is so thin that scientists call it an exosphere.

                    <p>
                        Venus, the sun's second planet, is somewhat smaller than Earth. It is the biggest planet visible in the night sky due to its close closeness to Earth. The cratered surface is heated, with surface temperatures around 900 degrees Fahrenheit (482 degrees Celsius), the result of a runaway greenhouse effect. Although its atmosphere is nowhere near as thick as that of any outer planet, it is the thickest of the terrestrial planets and is mostly composed of sulfuric acid and carbon dioxide. Because of the density of its atmosphere, the air pressure at the surface is 90 times that of Earth. The planet's heat and pressure make it unfriendly to life.

                        Earth, the third planet from the sun and the biggest terrestrial planet, is the only planet known to contain live creatures and liquid water on its surface. The atmosphere, which is mostly composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, is critical to Earth's capacity to support life. Although the earth's surface is largely water, the world also features huge landmasses that are home to a diverse range of ecosystems.

                        Since antiquity, astronomers have referred to Mars, the fourth planet from the sun, as the Red Planet. The surface's red tint is caused by iron oxide or rust in the soil. Mars' geography is distinguished by enormous volcanoes and deep valleys, and the planet is subjected to regular world-wide wind storms. Some of Mars' surface characteristics, such as dry river beds, suggest that water once existed on the planet and may still flow beneath the surface.

                        Jupiter, the first of the gas giant planets, is located farther from the sun, past a belt of asteroids. Its distinctive colored cloud patterns are created by massive, whirling storms in its atmosphere, which is mostly composed of hydrogen, helium, methane ammonia, and water ice. The Great Red Spot, the largest and most visible of the storms, is larger than Earth. Jupiter has 63 moons as well as a hazy ring system.

                    <p>
                        Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, is likewise a gas giant, with a vast and complicated ring system that is visible from afar. The rings form a narrow band approximately a mile thick that orbits the globe. Saturn's radius is around 9.5 times that of Earth, and it has 62 moons instead of one. Saturn's interior, like Jupiter's, is primarily comprised of hydrogen and helium. As you go closer to the core, the extreme pressure converts the gases into liquids, and then into a metallic state that conducts electricity.

                        While most planets rotate on an axis with a minor tilt, Uranus spins on an axis parallel to its orbit. With a diameter of 31,518 miles (50,723 kilometers), this chilly planet is four times the size of Earth and is composed of a thick core of frozen methane and a massive atmosphere of methane. Uranus has 27 moons in its orbit and a weak ring system.

                        Neptune, the blue planet, is the furthest from the sun and, like Uranus, is extremely frigid. It has a surface temperature of -353 F. (-214 C). Neptune's year is 165 Earth years long due to its distance from the sun and huge orbit. The planet's atmosphere is mainly methane, which gives it its blue appearance. The planet's chilly interior is mostly made up of methane ice. Neptune, like all of the outer planets, has a diameter nearly four times that of Earth. The planet is orbited by thirteen moons and a weak ring system.

            <h2>Interesting Facts</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
                1. Our solar system consists of a star, eight planets, and a plethora of smaller things such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.</p>
                <p>2. Our solar system travels at a speed of around 515,000 miles per hour around the center of the Milky Way galaxy (828,000 kph). We're in one of the spiral arms of the galaxy.</p>
                <p>3. One round around the galactic center takes our solar system roughly 230 million years.</p>
                <p> 4. Galaxies are classified into three types: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. Spiral galaxies, such as the Milky Way, are the most common type of galaxy.</p>
                <p>5. Our solar system is a space area. It lacks atmosphere. However, it has several worlds, including Earth, with various atmospheres.</p>
                <p>6. Our solar system's planets â€” and even some asteroids - have more than 200 moons in their orbits.</p>
                <p>7. Rings can be found on all four large planets and at least one asteroid. None are more impressive than Saturn's magnificent rings.</p>
                <p>8. Over 300 robotic spacecraft have explored places beyond Earth's orbit, including 24 American astronauts who traveled from Earth to the Moon.</p>
                <p>9. Our solar system is the only one known to be capable of supporting life. We only know of life on Earth so far, but we're seeking for more everywhere we can.</p>
                <p>10. The only spacecraft to exit our solar system are NASA's Voyager 1 and Voyager 2. Three more spacecraft will ultimately reach interstellar space: Pioneer 10, Pioneer 11, and New Horizons.</p>
